            The Ministry of Tourism has a scheme for granting approval to hotel projects from the point of view of this suitability for international tourists. 
            A classification committee set up by the Ministry classifies the functioning hotels under the star system into six categories from star one to five star deluxe. 
            Similarly, the Ministry has a scheme of approving Travel Agents, Tour Operators, Adventure Tour Operators and Tourist Transport Operators, the idea being to encourage quality,
            standard and service in these categories so as to promote Tourism in India.
            This is a voluntary scheme open to all bonafide agencies.
        </P>
